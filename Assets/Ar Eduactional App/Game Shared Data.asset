    m_Key: Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body
      to support life. It has a unique atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and
      oxygen, which helps sustain life. Earth's surface is about 70% water, with
      landmasses making up the remaining 30%. It orbits the Sun in an elliptical
      path and completes one rotation on its axis every 24 hours, resulting in day
      and night

      in the solar system. It is about one-quarter the size of Earth and has no atmosphere,
      resulting in extreme temperature variations. The Moon orbits Earth in approximately
      27.3 days, which is the same time it takes to complete one rotation on its
      axis, causing the same side to always face Earth. The Moon plays a significant
      role in influencing Earth\u2019s tides due to its gravitational pull."

    m_Key: The Sun is a massive ball of hot gases primarily composed of hydrogen
      and helium. It is the center of our solar system, providing the necessary heat
      and light for life on Earth. The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion,
      where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount
      of energy. It accounts for about 99.86% of the mass in our solar system, and
      its gravitational pull keeps the planets in orbit.

    m_Key: Mars, known as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun. It
      gets its reddish appearance from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has
      a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, and it has the largest
      volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. While it is much colder than Earth,
      scientists are intrigued by the possibility that water once existed on its
      surface, making it a key focus of exploration for signs of past life.

      a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and it has more than
      75 moons, including four large ones called the Galilean moons. Despite its
      size, a day on Jupiter lasts just under 10 hours due to its fast rotation.

      planet in the solar system and, like Jupiter, is a gas giant made primarily
      of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has over 80 moons, with Titan being the largest
      and one of the most intriguing due to its dense atmosphere and liquid lakes
      of methane.

    m_Key: Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the
      solar system. It has no atmosphere to retain heat, resulting in extreme temperature
      variations between day and night. Mercury has a rocky surface covered with
      craters, similar to our Moon, and it completes a full orbit around the Sun
      in just 88 Earth days, making its year the shortest in the solar system.

    m_Key: Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is similar in size to Earth,
      often referred to as Earth's "sister planet." However, its environment is extremely
      hostile, with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and a surface temperature hot enough
      to melt lead, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus rotates
      in the opposite direction of most planets, meaning it has a very long day,
      lasting about 243 Earth days.

    m_Key: Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique because it rotates
      on its side, making its axis nearly horizontal. It is classified as an "ice
      giant" due to its cold atmosphere, which is mainly composed of hydrogen, helium,
      and methane, giving it a pale blue color. Uranus has faint rings and at least
      27 moons. Its extreme axial tilt causes long periods of darkness or sunlight
      at its poles.

      Like Uranus, it is classified as an "ice giant" due to its cold, dense atmosphere.
      Neptune has a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere and is known
      for having the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of over
      1,500 miles per hour. Neptune also has faint rings and 14 known moons, the
      largest of which is Triton.

      up to 60 to 70 miles per hour in short bursts. Native to parts of Africa and
      Iran, cheetahs have a slender, lightweight body that helps them run incredibly
      fast. They have distinctive black "tear marks" running from the corners of
      their eyes down to their mouth, which help reduce glare and improve focus during
      high-speed chases. Cheetahs primarily hunt antelope and other small to medium-sized
      animals.
